# Project Setup

1. Fork this repository (https://github.com/letsmod/letsmod-interview) using your personal Github account.
2. Clone the forked repository in order to create a local working copy.
3. If not already installed, install the node package manager command line tools from  https://www.npmjs.com.
4. Run `npm install` from the project root directory of the working copy.

# Running the Project

To run this project, type `npm run dev` from the project root directory.  A local webserver should start and open the project in a new browser window.  Saving any changes to the source files should cause the page to reload with the updated code.

# Development

The project's base implementation can be found in `src/index.ts`.  Changes may be made directly to that file, or added to new files and imported into that file.  The other files included in this project's repository are there to facilitate quickly getting it to run in a browser; there should be no need to change them.

# Submission

You are encouraged to make commits to your working copy of the project as you add and change features.  When you are ready to submit your solution:

1. Push the changes from your working copy back to your fork.
2. Grant your interviewer(s) read access to your fork, using the github account(s) they provided.
3. Notify your interviewer(s) that your submission is ready for review.


-----My solution-----------------------------------------------------------------
The implementation just has a selection mechanism that adds an outline object 
around the current object and then removes it when deselected. For now, click
selects the object. 

I drew an excalidraw to outline the the process:-

There's a space there for feedback. I would really appreciate it if you took a few mins to write down your evaluation and comments on my thoughts. This helps me become a more all-rounded developer.

Thank you for the opportunity. This was a fun assignment.
